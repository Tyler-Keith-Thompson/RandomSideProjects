### Todo Server
This was a great way to learn a bit more about Server Side Swift. It's just a little TODO API, you know, the kind everybody and their dog creates. The difference here is that it is very well tested and it's done in GraphQL! I was very pleasantly surprised by how robust Vapor is already. After some hiccups with SPM this project went swimmingly and it was trivial to add new functionailty, test things, swap databases, you name it.

> NOTE: You need to open this `Package.swift` file with Xcode 13, I made use of a Swift 5.5 feature (throwing getters).
